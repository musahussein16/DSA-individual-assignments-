Description
The program consists of two main functions:

findsmallestnumber() - Takes an integer array and its size as input, then returns the smallest number in the array.

main() - Demonstrates the usage of the findsmallestnumber() function with a sample array.

How It Works
The algorithm initializes a variable smallest with the first element of the array.

It then iterates through the remaining elements of the array.

For each element, it compares the current element with smallest.

If the current element is smaller, it updates smallest with this value.

After checking all elements, it returns the smallest value found.
