# Second Largest Element Finder in C++

## Overview
This project implements an algorithm to find the second largest element in an array of integers using C++. The solution uses a single pass through the array to identify both the largest and second largest elements efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

## File Structure
- `second_largest.cpp`: Contains the complete implementation

## Code Description
The program consists of two main parts:

1. `findSecondLargest` function:
   - Takes an array and its size as parameters
   - Returns the second largest element or -1 if none exists
   - Uses two variables to track largest and second largest elements
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(1)

2. `main` function:
   - Demonstrates usage with a sample array
   - Prints the result

## Usage
1. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ second_largest.cpp -o second_largest
