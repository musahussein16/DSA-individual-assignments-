# Factorial Calculator in C++

## Overview
This project implements a recursive factorial calculation algorithm in C++. The factorial of a non-negative integer n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and recursion

## File Structure
- `factorial.cpp`: Contains the complete implementation

## Code Description
The program consists of two main parts:

1. `factorial` function:
   - Takes an integer n as input
   - Uses recursion to calculate factorial
   - Base cases: returns 1 for n = 0 or n = 1
   - Recursive case: n * factorial(n-1)
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(n) due to recursive call stack

2. `main` function:
   - Demonstrates usage with a sample number (5)
   - Prints the result

## Usage
1. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial
